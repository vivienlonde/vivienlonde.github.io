# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: >
  I am a Quantum Computer specialist.
  My interests in this field are foremost in quantum algorithms and quantum programming languages.
  I try to understand and explain the quantum computing stack from low level algorithms up to roadmaps for industrial applications.
  In my blog in French I focus on quantum algorithms.
  Previously I did my Phd on Quantum Error Correction under the supervision of Anthony Leverrier and Gilles ZÃ©mor.
  Apart from that I enjoy swimming, canoeing and hiking.
